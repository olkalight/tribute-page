      <h2>Museum of Imagination</h2>

      <p>
        Years of hard work and sacrifices was Tomasz’s cost to obtain the title of one of the creators         
        of the <q>Magical Realism</q> trend, there are few representatives of this trend as the creation
        of such works requires masterly techniques and huge imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sętowski opens <q>Museum of Imagination</q> in his home town - Częstochowa.
        The place holds a number of secrets, is a specific funfair of art, surprising with the myriad
        of amazing objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Museum the artist develops his visions in a lot of fields, it is here that Sętowski collects
        the best works of painting, sculpture, drawing and even unique jewellery pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visiting this magical place one can meet monumental installations taken out of his canvases, 
        and we feel like the characters from his stories. <q>Museum of Imagination</q> contains a gallery and a studio section.
      </p>
      <p>
        His collections are inspired by water and urban magic. The artist gives his favorite literary heroes
        a new image, and often takes on the role of a wizard in his own fairy-tale world.

          Mind is a characteristic factory of dreams opened for the time of creation.
          Making up monumental compositions is an attempt to exist in the world of imagination,
          away from the daily life."
